Make me an S3 policy!
====================

A Rack app to make S3 bucket policies. I got tired of copy-pasting and wanted to see how hard it'd be. It was pretty easy.

## How to use it

Go to http://make-me-an-s3-policy.herokuapp.com/ and throw a path on the end that's the name of your S3 bucket. ERB will take it from there.

## Todo
 - Understand how 'binding' works
